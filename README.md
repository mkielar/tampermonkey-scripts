# Tampermonkey Scripts
Just a bunch of scripts for TamperMonkey that I built for myself.
You can install them directly from https://openuserjs.org/users/mkielar/scripts.

## Note!
Since around November 2024, to make them work in Chromium-based Berowsers (Google Chrome, MS EDGE) you need to enable "Developer Mode" in "Extension" settings, due to introduction of "Manifest V3", which severely restricts what the extensions may do to the web page contents.
